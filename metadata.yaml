description: The less you have, the more careful you are of your possessions. Hunter
  and Johnson owned exactly a section and a half of land, and for a mile and a half
  Quirt Creek was fenced upon either side. They hired two men, cut what hay they could
  from a field which they irrigated, fed their cattle through the cold weather, watched
  them zealously through the summer, and managed to ship enough beef each fall to
  pay their grocery bill and their men's wages and have a balance sufficient to buy
  what clothes they needed, and perhaps pay a doctor if one of them fell ill. Which
  frequently happened, since Brit was becoming a prey to rheumatism that sometimes
  kept him in bed, and Frank occasionally indulged himself in a gallon or so of bad
  whisky and suffered afterwards from a badly deranged digestion.
